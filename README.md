# Flask Notes App

## Description
A simple Notes application built using Flask that allows users to create, view, and delete notes. This project was created by following a Flask tutorial to understand backend fundamentals and how Flask applications are structured.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project was learning and practice. Through building this app, I focused on:
- Flask application structure
- Routing and request handling
- Handling form submissions
- Jinja templating
- Basic CRUD operations
- Using SQLite with Flask

## Features
- Create new notes using a form
- View all saved notes
- Delete existing notes
- Persistent storage using SQLite
- Simple and minimal user interface

## Demo
A short demo video showing the core functionality of the application:
